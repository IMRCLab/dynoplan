# Dynoplan ðŸ¦–

By Joaquim Ortiz-Haro and Wolfgang Honnig

The first version [kinodynamic-motion-planning-benchmark](https://github.com/imrCLab/kinodynamic-motion-planning-benchmark) is now deprecated. 

## Robots and Problem Description 

Kinodynamic motion planning problem are defined in [dynobench](https://github.com/quimortiz/dynobench)

## How to use

we provide several exectuables and libraries to fit different use cases

## Testing

Check the tests to learn how to use the code! 

## Planners

- Pure Optimization-Base
- RRT* (ompl) + Optimization
- Idbastar (Iterative search and Optimization)
- Dbrrt, AO-dbrrt and DBrrtConnect (coming soon!)
- SST* (ompl)

## Building

Dependencies:

fcl (0.7)
yaml-cpp
Eigen 3
Crocoddyl (1.8)
OMPL (1.6)

Yes, you need OMPL 1.6 for planners RRT + TO and  SST  . You will need OMPL 1.6 -- we recommend to install OMPL in a local directory with -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, and use -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH here

## Motion Primitives

You will find a small set of motion primitives for each system in  [dynobench](https://github.com/quimortiz/dynobench).
I you want more primitives, e.g. to run our planner, use
wget ... 


## Benchmark 

Results of the benchmark in TRO are in folder XX. 
To replicate the results, use branch XX
and run the script : 

Benchmark between planners
```
python3
```

Study of heuristic functions
```
python3
```

Study of strategy for trajectoy optimization with free terminal time 
```
python3
```
