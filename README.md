The first version [kinodynamic-motion-planning-benchmark](https://github.com/imrCLab/kinodynamic-motion-planning-benchmark) is now deprecated. 

## Robots and Problem Description 

Kinodynamic motion planning problem are defined in [Dynobench](https://github.com/quimortiz/dynobench)

## How to use

we provide several exectuables and libraries for different different use cases

## Testing

Check the tests to learn how to use the code! 

## Planners

- Trajectory Optimization (Several Algorithms on top of Differential Dynamic Programming (Croccoddyl))
- RRT*-TO (Geometric Planner RRT* (OMPL)  + Trajectory Optimzation)
- iDb-A* (Iterative disccontinuity bounded search and Trajecgory Optimization)
- SST* (Stable Sparse Tree (OMPL))
- Dbrrt, AO-dbrrt and DBrrtConnect, DB-SST* (coming soon!)

## Building

You can check the Github CI [cmake.yml](.github/workflows/cmake.yml) to see how to compile the project in latest ubuntu (For ubuntu 20.04, we experienced some issues with g++-9, but clang-13 is fine.)

Dependencies:

* Boost 
* fcl (0.7)
* yaml-cpp
* Eigen3
* Crocoddyl (1.8)
* OMPL (1.6)

We need OMPL 1.6 for planners RRT + TO and  SST. We recommend to install OMPL in a local directory with -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, and use -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH here

## Motion Primitives

You will find a small set of motion primitives for each system in  [dynobench](https://github.com/quimortiz/dynobench).
I you want more primitives, e.g. to run our planner, use
wget ... 


## Benchmark 

Results of the benchmark in TRO are in folder XX. 
To replicate the results, use branch XX
and run the script : 

Benchmark between planners
```
python3
```

Study of heuristic functions
```
python3
```

Study of strategy for trajectoy optimization with free terminal time 
```
python3
```
